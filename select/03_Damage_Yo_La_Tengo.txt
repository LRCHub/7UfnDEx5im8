Not much Friday night, pinball, Lower East Side
Walked out of the past and into the bar
I used to think about you all the time
I would think about you all the time
Now it just feels weird, that there you are
The damage is done
Feeling like a kid again, my eyes are glued to the floor
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door
The damage is done
